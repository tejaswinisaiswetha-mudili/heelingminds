    <h2>Why You Must Take Online Therapy and Counselling for Your Mental Health</h2>
    <p>Counselling and Therapy can help improve symptoms of many mental health conditions. In therapy, people also learn to cope with symptoms that may not respond to treatment right away. Research shows the benefits of therapy last longer than medication alone. Medication can reduce some symptoms of mental health conditions, but therapy teaches people skills to address symptoms on their own. These skills last after therapy ends, and symptoms may continue to improve, making it less likely people will need further treatment.Mental health issues are common and increasing these days like Depression,Anxiety, Stress, Fear, Phobias, Obsessions, Addictions, Relationship issues, personality issues, family issues etc.A report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed that 7.5 percent of the Indian population suffers from some form of mental disorder. Mental illnesses constitute one-sixth of all health-related disorders and India accounted for nearly 15% of the global mental, neurological, and substance abuse disorder burden. The treatment gap, which is defined as the prevalence of mental illnesses and the proportion of patients that get treatment, is over 70 percent. WHO also predicts that by 2020, roughly 20 percent of India will suffer from mental illnesses. And to cater to this demographic, we have less than 4,000 mental health professionals.</p>

    <h2> Dealing with Anxiety Attacks</h2>
    <p>Panic becomes a disorder when panic attacks are frequent and interfere with a normal lifestyle. More specifically, the DSM-5 describes the criteria for panic disorder as panic attacks that must be associated with longer than 1 month of subsequent persistent worry about: (1) having another attack or consequences of the attack, or (2) significant maladaptive behavioral changes related to the attack.
To make the diagnosis of panic disorder, panic attacks cannot directly or physiologically result from substance use (intoxication or withdrawal), medical conditions, or another psychiatric disorder. Other symptoms or signs may include headache, cold hands, diarrhea, insomnia, fatigue, intrusive thoughts, and ruminations.[1]

    <h2> Impact of watching news channels covering War 24x7</h2>
    <p>he media we consume on a daily basis has an impact on our thoughts, actions, and feelings. If you watch or listen to the news on a regular basis, the majority of what you re hearing or seeing is likely about the recent Russia-Ukraine War.

People spend a significant amount of their leisure time online. We are increasingly relying on internet sources such as social media for news and other information. Following a crisis, social media is a vital means of disseminating information. In times of disaster, media consumption can be a useful tool, and it is often how people first learn about disasters.

Before, during, and after a tragedy, accurate and timely information is essential to keep families safe and prepared. However, it s equally crucial to recognize the dangers of constant exposure to graphic pictures and 24-hour news cycles to one s mental health. Because of their frequent updates, online news sources are ideally positioned to amplify harmful mental health impacts. Due to the continual updating of feeds with fresh information, thoughts and opinions that might masquerade as actual news reports, and its ability to hold a huge number of articles about the same topic from many perspectives, media can worsen negative mental health impacts.

Media attention before, during, and after a disaster can affect mental health issues such as sadness and anxiety, just as the event itself might. This can further lead to increase in absenteeism and affect workplace productivity.

Media exposure after a disaster can have a variety of mental health consequences, ranging from the normal sadness, worry, and anxiety to more serious consequences such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Rogers, 2013). Secondary traumatization may also be increased as a result of media exposure.

When tragedies occur, the constant stream of pictures on television and social media can have a strong psychological impact on children as well, whether they are directly in the path of danger or watching from thousands of kilometres away. A most recent study employs brain scans to demonstrate how simply viewing news coverage of disasters can increase children s anxiety and induce brain responses that put them at risk for post-traumatic stress symptoms (Dick et al., 2021).

In order to avoid such negative feelings to sink in, measures can be taken to keep safe distance from media. Keep track of how much media you consume on a daily basis and cut back if required. Checking in the morning and evening, for example, can keep you up to date while avoiding overexposure to disturbing material. When watching news coverage of the incident, be conscious of your emotions. Turn it off and do something else if you re anxious or unhappy. Articles with sensationalist titles or gory graphics should be avoided.
